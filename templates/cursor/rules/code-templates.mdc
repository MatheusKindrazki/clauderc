# Code Templates Reference

Quick access to templates for setting up AI coding assistant configurations in projects.

## Project Instructions Structure

```markdown
# Project Name

## Stack
- Language: X
- Framework: Y
- Package Manager: Z

## Commands
\`\`\`bash
# Dev
npm run dev

# Test
npm test

# Lint
npm run lint

# Build
npm run build
\`\`\`

## Workflow
- Verify before committing
- Break large tasks into smaller steps
- Test each change before proceeding

## Conventions
- Conventional Commits format
- Semantic Versioning
```

## Cursor Rules (MDC Format)

```markdown
---
description: When this rule applies
globs: **/*.ts
alwaysApply: false
---

Rule content in markdown.
```

### MDC Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `description` | Semantic description for when to apply (used for search) |
| `globs` | File patterns that activate the rule (e.g., `**/*.ts`) |
| `alwaysApply` | If `true`, rule is always included in context |

### Common Patterns

- **Always-apply rules**: Project conventions, commit format, coding standards
- **Glob-scoped rules**: Language-specific guidelines, framework patterns
- **Description-triggered rules**: Workflow rules activated by semantic matching
