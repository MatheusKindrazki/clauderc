# Project Setup Wizard

Analyze projects and create optimized configurations for AI coding assistants.

## Core Principles

1. **Explore First** - Understand stack, workflow, pain points before proposing
2. **Executable Config** - Every command must work immediately
3. **Context Economy** - Keep instructions concise, use references for details
4. **Verification First** - All workflows include validation steps

## Setup Workflow

### Phase 1: Analysis

1. Detect language, framework, package manager
2. Identify test, lint, format, build tools
3. Check for monorepo structure
4. Detect CI/CD platform
5. Check commit conventions (commitlint, husky, etc.)

### Phase 2: Generate Configuration

Based on analysis, create:

1. **`.cursorrules`** - Project instructions at root
   - Stack info
   - Commands (setup, dev, test, lint, build, verify)
   - Workflow guidelines
   - Conventions (Conventional Commits, Semantic Versioning)
   - Custom project rules

2. **`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`** - Specialized rules
   - `test.mdc` - Test execution rule
   - `lint.mdc` - Lint and format rule
   - `verify.mdc` - Full verification rule
   - `setup.mdc` - Dependency installation rule
   - `pr.mdc` - PR creation workflow
   - `commit.mdc` - Semantic commit workflow

### Phase 3: Validate

1. Verify all commands execute successfully
2. Ensure rules are correctly formatted (valid MDC frontmatter)
3. Confirm `.cursorrules` covers all essential project info

## Supported Stacks
